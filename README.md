# k8s-generator

Simple CLI for templating and injecting variables/secrets into configuration files from a variety of sources. 
This tool was created with the intention of being used to preprocess kubernetes manifests but it can handle any plain text files such as `.json`, `.ini`, `.yaml`, `.toml` etc.
